   For operators: the value of this property will not be remembered between invocations of the operator; instead, each invocation will start by using the default value. Also this property is not written to presets..

   Do not write in presets.
:ANIMATABLE: Animatable.

:PROPORTIONAL: Adjust values proportionally to each other.

:TEXTEDIT_UPDATE: Update on every keystroke in textedit 'mode'.

:OUTPUT_PATH: Output Path.
