Beztriple Interpolation Mode Items
##################################



**Interpolation**

Standard transitions between keyframes.

:CONSTANT: Constant.

   No interpolation, value of A gets held until B is encountered.
:LINEAR: Linear.

   Straight-line interpolation between A and B (i.e. no ease in/out).
:BEZIER: Bézier.

   Smooth interpolation between A and B, with some control over curve shape.


**Easing (by strength)**

Predefined inertial transitions, useful for motion graphics (from least to most "dramatic").

:SINE: Sinusoidal.

   Sinusoidal easing (weakest, almost linear but with a slight curvature).
:QUAD: Quadratic.

   Quadratic easing.
:CUBIC: Cubic.

   Cubic easing.
:QUART: Quartic.

   Quartic easing.
:QUINT: Quintic.

   Quintic easing.
:EXPO: Exponential.

   Exponential easing (dramatic).
:CIRC: Circular.

   Circular easing (strongest and most dynamic).


**Dynamic Effects**

Simple physics-inspired easing effects.

:BACK: Back.

   Cubic easing with overshoot and settle.
:BOUNCE: Bounce.

   Exponentially decaying parabolic bounce, like when objects collide.
:ELASTIC: Elastic.

   Exponentially decaying sine wave, like an elastic band.
