Constraint Type Items
#####################



**Motion Tracking**

:CAMERA_SOLVER: Camera Solver.

:FOLLOW_TRACK: Follow Track.

:OBJECT_SOLVER: Object Solver.



**Transform**

:COPY_LOCATION: Copy Location.

   Copy the location of a target (with an optional offset), so that they move together.
:COPY_ROTATION: Copy Rotation.

   Copy the rotation of a target (with an optional offset), so that they rotate together.
:COPY_SCALE: Copy Scale.

   Copy the scale factors of a target (with an optional offset), so that they are scaled by the same amount.
:COPY_TRANSFORMS: Copy Transforms.

   Copy all the transformations of a target, so that they move together.
:LIMIT_DISTANCE: Limit Distance.

   Restrict movements to within a certain distance of a target (at the time of constraint evaluation only).
:LIMIT_LOCATION: Limit Location.

   Restrict movement along each axis within given ranges.
:LIMIT_ROTATION: Limit Rotation.

   Restrict rotation along each axis within given ranges.
:LIMIT_SCALE: Limit Scale.

   Restrict scaling along each axis with given ranges.
:MAINTAIN_VOLUME: Maintain Volume.

   Compensate for scaling one axis by applying suitable scaling to the other two axes.
:TRANSFORM: Transformation.

   Use one transform property from target to control another (or same) property on owner.
:TRANSFORM_CACHE: Transform Cache.

   Look up the transformation matrix from an external file.


**Tracking**

:CLAMP_TO: Clamp To.

   Restrict movements to lie along a curve by remapping location along curve's longest axis.
:DAMPED_TRACK: Damped Track.

   Point towards a target by performing the smallest rotation necessary.
:IK: Inverse Kinematics.

   Control a chain of bones by specifying the endpoint target (Bones only).
:LOCKED_TRACK: Locked Track.

   Rotate around the specified ('locked') axis to point towards a target.
:SPLINE_IK: Spline IK.

   Align chain of bones along a curve (Bones only).
:STRETCH_TO: Stretch To.

   Stretch along Y-Axis to point towards a target.
:TRACK_TO: Track To.

   Legacy tracking constraint prone to twisting artifacts.


**Relationship**

:ACTION: Action.

   Use transform property of target to look up pose for owner from an Action.
:ARMATURE: Armature.

   Apply weight-blended transformation from multiple bones like the Armature modifier.
:CHILD_OF: Child Of.

   Make target the 'detachable' parent of owner.
:FLOOR: Floor.

   Use position (and optionally rotation) of target to define a 'wall' or 'floor' that the owner cannot cross.
:FOLLOW_PATH: Follow Path.

   Use to animate an object/bone following a path.
:GEOMETRY_ATTRIBUTE: Geometry Attribute.

   Retrieve transform from target geometry attribute data.
:PIVOT: Pivot.

   Change pivot point for transforms (buggy).
:SHRINKWRAP: Shrinkwrap.

   Restrict movements to surface of target mesh.
